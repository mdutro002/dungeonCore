# dungeonCore
While it's probably also a genre of metal, in this case dungeonCore is a lightweight web app to manage DnD campaigns.
Use it to track how many sessions you have going, see what characters are in play, and view the maps you're using.

-Secured login

### Build Notes
I'll be putting my ongoing notes on the build here.  
Here's the approximate build schedule I'll be adhering to:  

**Wednesday:** 
Starting off nice and easy with Heroku/Atlas configured and Deployed. Plotting course for development schedule, and creating this ReadMe  


**Thursday:**
Get all routes configured and tested, build seedroutes for users and campaigns, and get CRUD done if I can  


**Friday:**
This is has been set aside as a mental health day. I plan on certainly observing that and taking care of myself, but if I get too restless or anxious, it might actually be good for me to work on this. We'll see.  


**Saturday:**
By the time Saturday is done, I'd like to have any leftover CRUD work completed and Auth basics done  


**Sunday:**
Setting aside this for styling/bugs/catchup work - If I have everything working well, will work on stretch goals and additions.  


**Monday:**
At least have MVP done - any major bugs or issues should be addressed by this day  


**Tuesday:**
Prepare to present!

**Thursday:**  
I had the idea to have characters be a complex object in the campaigns model, but I'm going to limit this to be an array for now. I am concerned about getting the mvp built in time if I throw in too many new issues, I'll spend my time on those instead of base functionality.   

If I have time later on in the project week, I'll come back and work on that. Progress today was much slower than I'd like.
